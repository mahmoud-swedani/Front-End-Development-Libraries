# Responsively Style Checkboxes
* Since Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes are applicable to all form elements, you can use them on your checkboxes too! This way, the checkboxes will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

* Nest all three of your checkboxes in a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them in a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.

* All of your checkboxes should be nested inside one div with the class row.

* Each of your checkboxes should be nested inside its own div with the class col-xs-4.

* All of your div elements should have closing tags.
