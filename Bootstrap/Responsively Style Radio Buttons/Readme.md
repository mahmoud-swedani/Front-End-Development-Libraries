# Responsively Style Radio Buttons
* You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too! This way, our radio buttons will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

* Nest both your radio buttons within a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them within a <div class="col-xs-6"> element.

* Note: As a reminder, radio buttons are input elements of type radio.

* All of your radio buttons should be nested inside one div with the class row.

* Each of your radio buttons should be nested inside its own div with the class col-xs-6.

* All of your div elements should have closing tags.
