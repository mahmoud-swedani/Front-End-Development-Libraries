# Add Font Awesome Icons to all of our Buttons
* Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons can be web fonts or vector graphics. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.

* Use Font Awesome to add an info-circle icon to your info button and a trash icon to your delete button.

* Note: The span element is an acceptable alternative to the i element for the directions below.

* You should add a <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> within your info button element.

* You should add a <i class="fas fa-trash"></i> within your delete button element.

* Each of your i elements should have a closing tag and <i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i> is in your like button element.
