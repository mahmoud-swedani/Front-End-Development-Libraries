# Create a Custom Heading
* We will make a simple heading for our Cat Photo App by putting the title and relaxing cat image in the same row.

* Remember, Bootstrap uses a responsive grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.

* Nest your first image and your h2 element within a single <div class="row"> element. Nest your h2 element within a <div class="col-xs-8"> and your image in a <div class="col-xs-4"> so that they are on the same line.

* Notice how the image is now just the right size to fit along the text?

* Your h2 element and topmost img element should both be nested together within a div element with the class row.

* Your topmost img element should be nested within a div with the class col-xs-4.

* Your h2 element should be nested within a div with the class col-xs-8.

* All of your div elements should have closing tags.
